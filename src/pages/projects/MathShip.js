            One team member exhibited unresponsiveness during our online team
            meetings, contributing to a breakdown in effective communication
          </li>
          <li>
            The absence of clear leadership and direction became apparent,
            posing a challenge to the overall team dynamic
          </li>
          <li>
            The lack of active participation and contribution from one member
            underscored the importance of clear expectations and shared
            responsibilities in collaborative projects
          </li>
          <li>
            The experience emphasized the significance of fostering a supportive
            and communicative team environment to enhance overall productivity
            and project outcomes
